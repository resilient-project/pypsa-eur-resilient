      "TECHNICAL_DESCR": "<p>Hyperlink III, a hydrogen transport infrastructure in Germany though the route: Heidenau &ndash; Stade &ndash; Elbe S&uuml;d &ndash; Klein Offenseth &ndash; Fockbek &ndash; Ellund, connects to the Danish hydrogen network and facilitates the import of green hydrogen produced in Denmark.</p>\n\n<p>The related infrastructure will be planned and implemented in close cooperation with the Danish TSO Energinet. The resulting cross-border hydrogen transport network will extend from the underground hydrogen storage facility in Lille&nbsp;Torup&nbsp;via DK&nbsp;Hydrogen Pipeline West&nbsp;to Heidenau in the Hamburg area. It will also provide access to Storengy&rsquo;s SaltHy underground storage facility in Harsefeld. In Heidenau, Hyperlink III&nbsp;joins up with the other Hyperlink sections to enable the transmission of hydrogen to customers in other parts of Germany too.</p>\n\n<p>The project covers up to 198 km of new pipelines and aims at the transmission capacity of 2.5 GWh/h (0.3 Mt/y) by&nbsp;2028, with a further potential of&nbsp;4.3 GWh/h by 2030 and&nbsp;10 GWh/h as of&nbsp;2035.</p>\n\n<p>Hyperlink III&nbsp;will make it possible, in a close cooperation with a regional DSO, to reach the industrial region of Brunsb&uuml;ttel/Heide and prospective large customers (producers and offtakers) in Schleswig-Holstein and North-Eastern Lower Saxony. The project could also eventually facilitate offshore hydrogen imports with the integration of the future hydrogen import terminal in Brunsb&uuml;ttel.</p>\n",
