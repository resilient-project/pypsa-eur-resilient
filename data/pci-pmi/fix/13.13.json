The N-LiTES storage site is located offshore Norway, and the CO2 receiving terminal is at the Energy Park located in the &Oslash;ygarden municipality, west of Bergen, Norway. The pipeline from the CO2 receiving terminal to the storage site is about 100 km long.&nbsp;<br />\n<br />\nThe project is developed in two stages:</p>\n\n<p>Phase 1 (outside the scope of this PMI): Capacity to transport, inject and store up to 1.5 Mt/y CO2, where ca. 800 ktpa reserved for the two capture projects in the Longship. Construction of both on- and offshore facilities commenced in 2021, and Phase 1 is planned to be ready for operations in 2024.</p>\n\n<p>Phase 2: This phase will allow for expansion of the CO2 transport, onshore handling and offshore storage capacity to up to 5 Mt/y. Part of the Phase 1 infrastructure has already been designed for Phase 2 capacity, this includes the offshore pipeline, and the umbilical to the offshore template.</p>\n\n<p>The infrastructure elements comprising this PMI related to Phase 2, are as follows:</p>\n\n<p>- A dedicated CO2 collection pipeline from the receiving terminal in the &Oslash;ygarden municipality to the storage site, built as part of phase 1.</p>\n\n<p>- Onshore receiving terminal with intermediate storage tanks and export pumps. Shipping solutions are not part of the PMI.</p>\n\n<p>- Subsea facilities, umbilical and flowlines associated to the CO2 storage acreage in Norway.</p>\n\n<p>- Any equipment or installation for the operation of the project, including protection, control and monitoring systems.</p>\n",
